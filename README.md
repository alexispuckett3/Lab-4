# Lab-4



Conclusion

By the end of this lab, the better understanding of Op Amps was obtained and learned. On top of this the learning about the benefits and drawbacks of Op Amps were also obtained and learned. By using a unity gain, moderate gain, high gain inverting Op Amp circuits, as well as a voltage follower circuit, integrating Op Amp circuit, and differentiating Op Amp circuit we were able to form a better understanding of how gain can change due to resistance, current and voltage that are passing through the differing circuits.
